## explor

`explor` is an R package to allow interactive exploration of multivariate analysis results.

For now on, it is usable on two types of analyses :

Analysis | Function  | Package | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ---------- | --------
Principal component analysis  | PCA  | [FactoMineR](http://factominer.free.fr/) | Qualitative supplementary variables are not taken into account
Multiple correspondence analysis  | MCA  | [FactoMineR](http://factominer.free.fr/) | -

The philosophy behind `explor` is to only be an exploration interface which doesn't really do anything by itself : analysis and computations are made in your R script, and `explor` only helps you visualizing the results. As such it can not disrupt code execution and reproducibility.

## Features

For each type of analysis, `explor` launches a `shiny` interactive Web interface which is displayed inside RStudio or in your system Web browser. This interface provides a series of tabs with interactive data and graphics.

These data and graphics are displayed with several "interactive" features. Numerical results are shown as dynamic tables which are sortable and searchable thanks to the `DT` package. Most graphics are generated with the `scatterD3` package which provides the following features :

- zoom with your mousewheel
- pan with your mouse
- tooltips when hovering points
- points highlighting when hovering legend items
- draggable labels
- ability to export the currently displayed plot as an SVG file
- fully updatable plot, which means than any change in the interface controls leads to an animated transition, which can give some interesting visual clues.



## Usage

Usage is very simple : you just apply the `explor()` function to the result object of one of the supported analysis functions.

Example with a principal correspondence analysis from `FactoMineR::PCA` :

```r
library(FactoMineR)
data(decathlon)
pca <- PCA(decathlon[,1:12], quanti.sup = 11:12, graph = FALSE)
explor(pca)
```

Example with a multiple correspondence analysis from `FactoMineR::MCA` :

```r
library(FactoMineR)
data(hobbies)
mca <- MCA(hobbies[1:1000, c(1:8,21:23)], quali.sup = 9:10, 
           quanti.sup = 11, ind.sup = 1:100)
explor(mca)
```


## Feedback

`explor` is quite a young package, so there certainly are bugs or problems. Thanks for reporting them by mail or by opening an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/juba/explor/issues)
